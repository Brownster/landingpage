        <p>Professional Overview</p>

        <h2>Experience Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Marc Anthony Brown, and I've spent over 24 years in the telecoms industry. My journey began as an apprentice linesman, 
            and I've since become a senior engineer specializing in AVAYA systems. I've worked in various roles, including an onsite 
            support engineer at Sabio LTD, where I maintained Avaya infrastructures for clients like YBS Group HRG, JD Williams, 
            and Homeserve.
        </p>
        <p>
            At CCT / Capita, I furthered my expertise as a Field Engineer, with a focus on Avaya IP Office systems and CM solutions. 
            Along the way, I've earned certifications such as the Avaya Certified Installation Specialist, Maintenance Specialist, 
            and the AWS Solutions Architect Associate.
        </p>
        <p>
            What truly drives me is my passion for customer service. Interacting with customers is where I'm at my best, 
            and it's at the core of everything I do. I believe in building strong relationships and ensuring that every interaction 
            is a positive experience. Throughout my career, I've always prioritized learning and delivering top-notch service 
            in the telecoms space.
